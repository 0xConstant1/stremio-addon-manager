                What risks are involved?

                This was whipped together in a couple of hours. It is not well tested and may break your Stremio
                profile. Stremio functionality relies on the existence of certain addons (ie, Cinemeta). It is
                possible that the order of addons is also important to some functionality.

            <p>
                There is currently no way to 'reset' your addons to previous configurations or default
                configurations.

                Can I use this to move Cinemeta catalogs from the top?
            </summary>
            <p>
                Yes! This will allow you to move the Cinemeta provided catalogs (ie, Popular - Series/Movie and Featured -
                Series/Movie) from the top of your catalog list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do note that the in-built 'Continue watching' catalog cannot be moved from the top.
