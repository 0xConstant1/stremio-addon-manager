                This was whipped together in a couple of hours. It is not well tested and may break your Stremio
                profile. Stremio functionality relies on the existence of certain addons (ie, Cinemeta). It is
                possible that the order of addons is also important to some functionality.

                There is currently no way to 'reset' your addons to previous configurations or default
                configurations.
